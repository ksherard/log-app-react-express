Plan of action to break this work down and deliver.

- Requirements
	- Break down assessment into requirements
	- Clarify requirements (Normally we would test/verify the requirements stated and determine non-functional requirements and establish SLA goals. We will skip and document assumptions since this is an offline assessment)
	- Define what is in scope (given the short time window)
- Architecture, Infrastructure, Deployment & Security
	- Define Architecture (skipping since we are running locally and time-boxing the solution)
- Application Design
	- Define application architecture
		- Define Data Dictionary to fit requirements
		- Define Data Model
		- Determine technology for backend
			- Choose integration pattern
		- Determine technology for frontend (React/TS - per requirements)
	- Front End Design and accessibility
		- Design UI to accomplish user's objectives
		- Utilize established design library to shortcut design and accessibility efforts.
	- Backend
		- Choose light weight BE tech/framework
		- Choose integration pattern that suites the UX and Data Model
- Testing
	- Front End - Unit Tests
	- Backend - Unit Tests
	- End to End Testing - Out of scope
- Documentation
	- ReadMe
